Hstore allows you to store hashes in a postgres database table column.

Important to remember that postgres `superuser` permission is required to actually switch on this extension.

When adding a hstore column in my rails app, and running the migration on production. I received

`permission denied to create extension "hstore"`

To fix this I needed to login to postgres manually as a superuser and run

`CREATE EXTENSION hstore;`

manually on the database in question.
