I run emacs via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) which means if I want to use custom fonts they actually need to be in my linux subsystem rather than windows.

It's as easy as adding a `~/.fonts` directory, and moving any fonts that you would like available into there.

Finally I got FiraCode working - my faviourite font.
