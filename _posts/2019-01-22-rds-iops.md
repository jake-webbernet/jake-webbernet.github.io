I'm not an RDS expert and I was recently caught out by not monitoring the IOPS consumed by my RDS Postgres instance.

We recently got a large influx of traffic on one of our websites that tested the durability of our RDS instance. One afternoon I received an alert email from Amazon Cloudwatch noting that there one of the websites we maintain had an average latency of about 1-2 seconds.

I jumped onto the website and confirmed it was at an absolute crawl. 

I had seen this before and immediately checked my Postgres database for any abnormalities
