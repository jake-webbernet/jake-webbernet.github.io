I needed to give a presentation on a new piece of software that our team has been building.

Some things I learned:

* Initially I had the idea of running a demo live, with the actual browser open
  * This would have put a lot of pressure on whomever was running the laptop. It would have involved a lot of rehearsal.
  * It would have been restrictive from the sense that you could not easily zoom in and focus on specific parts of the screen.
  * The back of the room might have had trouble seeing what I was talking about

* Next idea was to use screen recording software (such as Camtasia) to be able to record a walkthrough of using the software.
  * The plan was to record one large video (say, 5 minutes) and then Pause/Play live to be able to stop and talk
    * This meant that title slides needed to be only a couple seconds long so that we didn't have to make the audience wait when pressing play
    * Problems or Risks with this approach were mainly that we had a very small margin for error. If we missed a pause point we would have to go backwards
    
* Next idea was to use Powerpoint as the backbone
  * Created title slides so that we had specific points that the presentation would just stop and allow me to give an overview
  * Create many smaller videos that we simply embed in the powerpoint
  * Powerpoint has this neat feature called `bookmarks` that allow you to set specific points in a video. I assume this is to make it easier to jump to instead of using the seek bar.
      * I found that using the `animations` feature in Powerpoint, and a custom trigger, I was able to setup Powerpoint to pause at specific points of the video
      * This made it really easy for the person running the powerpoint, as it paused when I needed it to and they just resumed when I gave them a nod.
  * This allowed me to go at my own pace and there was no stress
  * It was really easy to embed new videos. I was able to record new videos the day of the presentation and embed them in with ease
      
All in all, Camtasia and Powerpoint are a really powerful comobo when doing software presentations
